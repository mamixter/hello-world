Hi all!
This is Mark Andrew Mixter.  I am a veteran software engineer pursuing my dream of owning my own business called Liverance, LLC. 
Liverance is an old historical noun meaning generally:  "A provison of a good or service".  One can't be more general in a business name.  I like it.  It gives me flexibility; a goal of business ownership.  Liverance is also a surname of a family that one of my great aunts married into...  So I share some common ancestry with some of the Liverance family.   I hope they forgive me for activing the name again in another business context. I was inspired by an old photo I inherited of an early "Liverance Grocery" in Michigan; the state where I was born and raised.

I am choosing to invest now in software and general interests of my own choosing. I had a number of good ideas I saw others implement in my career. It is time I "catch the waves" of my own ideas. My career has primarily on backend processing (middleware, services, drivers, and client database connectivity).  Why change now?  I don't call myself a "Fullstack" developer.  A "Backend" developer is much closer to the truth. The bulk of my experience is with C and C#.  I will be biased toward those (and similiar) languages. I am a fan and alumni of iDesign.net training. I am interested in all cloud platforms; and the especially the integration of cognitve functionality.

Expect my projects to be services for application web access and work that will monetize the Internet Of Things (IoT) expansion.  
I am in creative mode now.  Let the fun begin!  Connect with me on LinkedIn if you want more information.

Cheers Mark
